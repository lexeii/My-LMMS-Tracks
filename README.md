# My LMMS Tracks

All the tracks are written in LMMS, earlier in the old version 0.4.13 (possibly), and recently in version 1.2.0.

  - You can freely listen to my tracks on the [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/lexeii),
    like them, make reposts and write comments.
  - On [Bandcamp](https://lexeii.bandcamp.com/) you can hear and buy (or download free of charge)
    my latest tracks.

Initially, I used only the sounds built into LMMS, mostly ZynAddSubFx plugin,
because it gives the greatest variety of sound.
Homemade chiptune music did not appeal to me at all.

But over time, in LMMS, in addition to the ZynAddSubFx plugin and a dozen of chiptune instruments,
there was a real treasure for me — Sf2 Player!

I started looking for sf2 files — something that Sf2 Player can play.
(And I still continue to search for a new sounds.)
At first I used [GeneralUser](http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php).
Standard sounds familiar from youth.
But even such sounds made it possible to diversify and decorate my melodies by applying
“more human” musical instruments to my purely synthesizing sound.

Next, I came across a topic [3.5 Gb Of Hq Ochestral Sf2!](https://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1200140/1)
on the Newgrounds forum. I downloaded them all and carefully sorted them by type of instrument.
Having examined what became available to me, I made some conclusions:

  - Yes, there are really VERY many of them.
    So many that it’s hard to choose what you need,
    or just get inspired by the new sound of a random instrument.
  - Most of the instruments were created long ago, have a low sampling frequency
    (22,050 Hz or 16,000 Hz or so on, probably to reduce the file size),
    and an unnatural “plastic” sound.
  - The issue of the licensed cleanliness of the laid out instruments
    is not at all clear, although the TS claims that they were freely downloaded legally.
    Since I was going to show my music to other people (and not listen to it privately),
    I need to be sure that I have the right to use these instruments as I need to,
    and distribute the music created with them.

Other places where I downloaded the sf2 instruments (the list is perhaps incomplete):

  - [S. Christian Collins web site](http://www.schristiancollins.com/soundfonts.php).
    Some free musical instruments.
  - [simant.ru](https://simant.ru/pub/multimedia/Samples/sf2/).
    The [notice](https://simant.ru/%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB%D1%8B/) reads:
    *Attention! All files in this section are for reference only! By clicking on the download link, you agree to delete files from your computer after reviewing.*
    But I also doubt that all these files belong to the user who posted them, and
    that he has the right to voice such ultimatums, and that you can legally use these files in your music.
  - [FreePats project](http://freepats.zenvoid.org/). (Not so large, but) free and open collection
    of digital instruments for music production.
  - [FlameStudios collections](http://www.flamestudios.org/free/Soundfonts).
    GNU GPL licensed sf2 instruments: percussions, bass guitars, electro guitars.
  - [Soundfonts 4U](https://sites.google.com/site/soundfonts4u/).
    Giant-sized collection of high-quality musical instruments.

Some other resources:

  - [Orange Free Sounds](http://www.orangefreesounds.com/). Samples and sound effects.
  - [SampleSwap](https://sampleswap.org/). Free audio samples.


In conclusion, I want to say:
“Stay in touch!”
Don't forget your favorite indie musicians on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/).
Tell them how you love their music! It really motivates to continue.
